# EVENT API Management (PUB-SUB) MODEL

## Description

This project contains the sample code used to build the Event Management in Publish-Subscriber Model for the Clients .
This is developed in Spring Boot Application

## How does it work?

You can use the endpoints below

POST - http://localhost:8080/event-api.
GET  - http://localhost:8080/auth/metric-graph

Please find the Class Diagram(UML) & Postman Collections in the project directory.


Actually, much better if you just start the application and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`. There you'll find a nice API documentation.
